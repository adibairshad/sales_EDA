# sales_EDA
In this project I did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sales data.
I used count plot,Bar plot, Pie Chart, Line chart to gain insight.

# Conclusion
These are the insights I gained from EDA
1. December month has the most number of sales while January has least. The reasons might be Christmas, New Year.
2. San Francisco has the highest number of orders and Austin has the least.
3. AAA Batteries (4-pack)" and "AA Batteries (4-pack)" have the highest quantity ordered, these are the most popular item with least costs.
4. "Macbook Pro Laptop" and "ThinkPad Laptop" have lower quantities ordered, suggesting that their higher prices may affect their demand.
5. AA Batteries (4-pack) and AAA Batteries (4-pack) show a consistent demand across all months.
6. Most people buy 'iPhone and Lightning charging cable' together. Suggesting iPhone does not provide chargers anymore or the chargers they are providing have low charing speed.
